# hello-world
First repository 

This is my first repository on GitHub. I will write programs on it using Python as programming language. Python language is very interesting and not too hard to learn and this is one of the programming languages I learned with interest. I will try writing programs in other languages also.

Now I am editing this repo on the day I started a Full-stack developer course at General Assembly in San Francisco. Today is 10/29/2018 Monday.

Okay!  Okay!!  Okay!!!
